# testdata

This directory contains data used by `main_test.go` for end-to-end testing.

The files in [pages/](pages/) and [librarycongress.json](librarycongress.json)
were generated by processing the [@librarycongress] timeline and can be updated
by passing the `-update-pages` and `-update-golden` flags, respectively.

Copyright for all data is held the U.S. Library of Congress. I guess? Hopefully
it's cool to check it into a repository.
