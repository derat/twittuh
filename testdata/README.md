# testdata

This directory contains data used by `main_test.go` for end-to-end testing.

The files in [pages/](pages/) and [librarycongress.json](librarycongress.json)
were generated by modifying `getTimeline` in `main.go` to use the cache when
fetching timeline pages and then running:

```
twittuh -cache-dir testdata/pages -format json librarycongress testdata/librarycongress.json
```

Congress. I guess? Hopefully it's cool to check it into a repository.
