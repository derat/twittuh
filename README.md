# twittuh

This is a small Go program that scrapes a user's Twitter timeline (using the
simple HTML-only version of the site served to clients that don't support
JavaScript) and generates an RSS feed containing their tweets.

I don't have (or want, really) a Twitter account, but I'm finding myself
repeatedly clicking on a dozen or so bookmarks to check for updates. It feels
like I'm in the year 2000. Thanks to this program, I can use an RSS reader to
monitor these timelines, making me feel like I'm in the year 2005 instead.
